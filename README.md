🧠 What is CheCore?

CheCore is a high-performance firmware designed to push the ESP32 to its limits for:

- 📡 Wireless environment visibility
- 📶 Protocol behavior simulation (lab use)
- 🔵 BLE signal experimentation
- 🪪 RFID interaction and logging
- 🌐 On-device control via web interface

Built with FreeRTOS + low-level WiFi control, optimized for stability, concurrency, and long runtime.

🚀 Getting Started

ANDROID 
1. INSTALL ESP32 FLASHER APP FROM ANY APP STORE 
2. SELECT THE CORRECT OFFSET FILES

     |
     ————–
           Bootloader-0x1000
      Partition Table-0x8000
         App Firmware-0x10000
3. flash the esp32
(in some esp32 we need to hold boot button till flashing complete)
